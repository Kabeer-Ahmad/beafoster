                <p>
                  Bea Foster, Ph.D., is a widely respected designer whose name has become synonymous with fashion, beauty, and interior design. For more than 50 years, her dedication, hard work, and distinctive vision have made her one of the most sought-after designers in Columbus, Ohio and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2000, Bea opened her first design studio in Columbus. Alongside her talented design team, she specialized in custom window treatments, accessories, and original art—featuring exclusive pieces by one of her favorite American artists, Mrs. Mary Ann Anderson. Her exquisite drapery work earned her the affectionate title “The Queen of Swags.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Never one to limit her creativity, Bea expanded into fashion with a specialty line of men’s and women’s wear, all personally designed by her. She also shares her expertise by teaching sewing, design, and modeling to both adults and young students. After her dynamic involvement with the legendary Ebony Fashion Shows, Bea was appointed by Mayor Michael B. Coleman to the board of the Columbus Historical Society, where she served from 2008 to 2011.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her work and influence have been featured in numerous media outlets, including The Columbus Dispatch, Columbus Monthly, and Buckeye Lifestyle Magazine. In 2019, she graced the cover of The Columbus Dispatch—a moment of recognition that moved her to tears. In 2025, she was honored as Model of the Year by the Columbus Fashion Council and her loving fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bea also ventured into the beauty and lifestyle world with the launch of <strong>Honey Bea</strong>, a luxurious body-care and pampering line for both men and women. Honey Bea has since expanded to include travel bags and personalized athletic wear in her signature black-and-white palette. Inspired by the brand’s success, her son introduced the complementary line <strong>B. Sporty</strong>, which will be formally launched for the New Year 2026.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A prolific author, her memoir <em>Designing In The Dark</em> was published in 2019, followed by <em>Bea And Beauty</em> in 2020. She is currently writing her third book, <em>Thriving Beyond The Darkness</em>—a second look at life, strength, and never giving up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Deeply committed to her community, Bea is active in civic and professional organizations and chairs several women’s civic groups. Bilingual in English and Greek (mastered during her travels to Athens and Mykonos in 1960), she blends global perspective with local impact.

              I truly love what I do. Giving back warms my heart and brings me great joy. My deepest desire is to strengthen the weak, to help them stand taller, walk in confidence, and become stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Black Tie Chandelier is more than an elegant event—it is a building platform I will use to help others grow. Through my online courses and programs, I want to change lives for the better, both inside and out.
            </p>
            <p>
              After losing two precious granddaughters to cancer, I knew I had to find a way to keep their memory alive and to be part of the change that leads to healing and, one day, a cure. On the wings of those two little butterflies we lost, I continue to move forward—creating spaces, experiences, and opportunities that help others feel good about themselves, rediscover their beauty, and believe in their future.
